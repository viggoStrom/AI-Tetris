# TetrisAI

## Disclaimer
This was intended to be my thesis project for _gymnasiet_ but it never paned out. I instead pivoted to [comparing sorting algorithms](https://github.com/viggoStrom/GA-Sorteringsalgoritmer).

## Goal
Can a reinforcement trained AI that plays Tetris, play with [pentominoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentomino) or will it be over trained?
